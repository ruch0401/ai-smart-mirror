# Artificially Intelligent Smart Mirror

## Introduction

Not a day goes by when some of us don’t ponder as to how Artificial Intelligence will one day take over the reigns on this world and overpower humanity. But do we actually understand Artificial Intelligence? A very few of us do. However, we are surrounded by technology these days most of which comes equipped with artificial intelligence. To put it into more simple terms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligence displayed by machines in contrast to the Natural Intelligence displayed by humans. We know that life today is fast. We need to have information on the go. With everything getting
smart and interactive, exchange of knowledge and information gets easier. But a lot of our time is whiled away doing the general chores and getting ready. Imagine a scenario when you come in front of your mirror to get dressed and your own personal AI is at your disposal for a series of tasks and updates that you demand from it. Your customised newsfeed, weather updates, and a plethora of services in the go. The Smart Mirror aims to be your interactive assistant.

## Objective

- To design and prototype a device that acts as a “Smart Mirror” by providing customizable information on the display.
- To act as a conventional mirror while also superimposing informational data, which can be customized by the user.
- To allow for touch free user interaction with inbuilt voice recognition feature.
- To provide the users with the ability to create a profile and customize the visual interface to display what specific data feeds they want.

## Need

Time is precious and precious things need to be saved and taken care of. Our project aims to do just that.
